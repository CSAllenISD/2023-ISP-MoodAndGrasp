        <h2>What is it?</h2>
        <p>A mood and grasp graph is a practice to gather feedback on students emotions and grasp of concepts and deliver in-the-moment supports; typically done via surveys. Weekly or daily SEL check-ins not only elevate student voice, they can also help students gain awareness of their emotions and work on self-awareness, social awareness, and responsible decision-making.

        <h2>The Benefits</h2>
        <p>Extensive research has shown that students who participate in SEL programs demonstrate 11% gains in academics, improved classroom behavior, better stress management, and higher attendance. As the body of research on social-emotional learning grows, district and school leaders are focusing on infusing SEL into the classroom through different programs and activities.
